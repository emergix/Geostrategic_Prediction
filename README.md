## Overview

This presentation explores the intersection of **natural language processing**, **transformers**, and **optimal transport theory** to predict geostrategic events. It connects statistical physics, quantum theory, and advanced information geometry with modern AI architectures, aiming to model and anticipate complex global developments.

## Key Topics

- **Event Prediction Dataset**: Leveraging the GDELT database (1979–present) and CAMEO codes to build sequences of geopolitical events.
- **Transformers and NLP**: Embedding event sequences using transformers to model the evolution of global events.
- **Mathematical Tools**:
  - Gradient flows
  - KL divergence
  - Gram matrices and RKHS
  - Renyi entropy and mutual information
  - Wasserstein geometry and optimal transport
- **Quantum Connections**: Parallels with density operators and quantum statistical physics.
- **Mean-Field Theories and Variational Inference**: Application to neural networks and AI modeling.
- **Sinkhorn Algorithm**: Efficient computation of optimal transport with entropic regularization.

## Conceptual Inspirations

- Asimov's **Psychohistory**: Predicting collective human behavior.
- Kurzweil’s **Singularity**: The convergence of human and machine intelligence.

## Conclusion

AI, particularly NLP, is positioned to transform societal understanding. Tools from physics and geometry are key to constructing models of prediction at scale.
